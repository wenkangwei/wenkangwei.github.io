# Who am I?
__Machine Learning Fan and Researcher -__  I'm a second-year master student of computer engineering with minor of Computer Science.  So far, I'm doing researches about transfer learning and GAN. I'm working with [Dr. Adam hoover](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/) on Human activity (Eating) pattern recognition research. I'm also a research assistant in Clemson-Clair Lab of [Dr. Kai Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/kailiu/home) with research topic of GAN and machine learning optimization.

__Job Seeker -__ I'm actively looking for a full-time job related to __Data Scientist, Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer__ that starts from Summer 2021 after my graduation in May 2021
My Resume can be found [Here](https://github.com/wenkangwei/wenkangwei.github.io/tree/master/Files/DataEngineer-WenkangWei.pdf) or  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenkang-wei-588811167/)
You are welcomed to email me if you have any suggestion or reference to me. 

__blogger -__ I find that writing blogs can help me manage my tehcnical notes and problems I solved in the past. What's more, it provides a platform for me to communicate techniques with more people.
So, right now, I'm trying to manage my technical notes and my thoughts on some problems I wrote in the past.

__Geek -__ I usually find some technical projects to do once I'm leisure. Some projects are inspired by my daily life, my classes on campus and my researches. To know more about it, Click [HERE](https://github.com/wenkangwei)


__Dreamer -__ I usually imagine how our brains work and ponder how AI will collaborate with human in the future and how can we borrow human learning behaviors or architectures of human brain to design a new AI algorithm. Hopefully, the secret behine human brain can be revealed one day.

__Amateur of painting__
I'm a fan of japanese animes and hence sometimes do some paintings related to anime characters.

# Educational Background
I'm a master student of computer engineering with the focus area of intelligent system and pattern recogniton. I have received the BS degree with EE major and named to Dean's List as well in Clemson Univeristy. If you are interested in my academic achievements, Click [HERE](https://meritpages.com/wenkan)
